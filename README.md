# Comprehensive_YouTube_Data_Analysis
Conducted in-depth YouTube data analysis using Python libraries. Employed textblob for sentiment analysis, wordcloud for visualization, and emoji for emoji patterns. Used seaborn for engagement metrics and views vs. likes correlations. Exported data with pandas and examined punctuation impact on engagement. Enhanced analysis skills.

### Project Overview
I conducted an in-depth analysis of YouTube data, utilizing advanced Python libraries to extract insights into audience sentiment, engagement, and content performance.

For sentiment analysis, I employed textblob to categorize comments into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. To visualize frequently used words in positive and negative comments, I generated wordclouds using the wordcloud library. Emoji usage patterns were analyzed with the emoji library and collections.Counter.

To evaluate audience engagement, I utilized seaborn barplots to examine metrics such as likes, dislikes, and comment counts. Regression plots and heatmaps from seaborn were applied to explore the relationship between views and likes. Data was exported to CSV and JSON formats using pandas for further analysis and sharing.

The most liked video categories were identified through data extraction and manipulation. Additionally, I investigated the effect of punctuation on engagement metrics using the string package and visualized the results with box plots.

This project significantly enhanced my data analysis and visualization skills, providing valuable insights into YouTube content dynamics and audience interactions.
